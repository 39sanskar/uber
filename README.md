- Uber Clone is a full-stack ride-hailing application   designed to replicate the core features of Uber while providing a customizable and    scalable architecture. The platform connects passengers and drivers in real time, enabling quick and secure ride bookings.
The application features user and driver authentication, allowing each to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Passengers can request rides by selecting pickup and drop-off locations via an integrated maps API, while drivers can accept or reject requests based on availability.

- Real-time communication between passengers and drivers is handled through WebSockets or API polling, ensuring smooth ride status updates from booking to completion. The app also supports fare estimation, trip history, and ride cancellation options.

- The backend is built with a secure and modular architecture, managing ride data, authentication, and payment handling. The frontend is fully responsive, offering an intuitive interface for both desktop and mobile users.

- This project demonstrates proficiency in API integration, geolocation services, state management, and full-stack development, making it a solid showcase for backend logic, frontend UI/UX, and real-time features.
